# MathsTests
Don’t you think that maths is hard? You’re right, but I love it. That’s why I made this app: MathsTests can help you factorizing polynomials and particular trinomials using Ruffini’s rule! Fast, lightweight and open-source, it’s a great app for everyone who needs help with polynomials. I’m not in charge if you take a bad mark after using it during a test!
## Supported:
- Trinomail factoring
- Ruffini's rule solver
- Material design
