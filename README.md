##Easter egg FAQ
<b>Where is the easter egg?</b>
Ahahah! This is a mistery!
<br><b>How can I win?</b> This easter egg is a small game. You can click only the <i>right</i> numbers, or the app will crash. If the number displayed is not <i>right</i>, click outside it.
<br><b>Which numbers are <i>right</i>?</b> Eh, that's a big question.
